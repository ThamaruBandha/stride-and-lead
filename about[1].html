      <!-- TITLE + BIG PARAGRAPH -->

        <h2 class="section-title">About me</h2>

        <p>
        I’ve just finished my twelfth grade, but most of my education didn’t happen inside
        classrooms. It happened on dusty Kho Kho grounds, usually before school began or
        long after it ended. I first stepped onto that ground in seventh grade, unsure of
        my speed and unaware of how deeply the game would shape the way I think.
        </p>

        <p>
        At first, I was only a player, learning when to sprint, when to stop, and how to
        stay alert even when my lungs burned. But slowly, roles shifted. I became a captain.
        Then a mentor. Soon, I was guiding under-14 teams, leading juniors through
        inter-school competitions, and learning that responsibility feels very different
        when others depend on your decisions.
        </p>

        <p>
        My days began early. Some mornings started at five, before school, marking courts
        with chalk on uneven ground. Other days ended late, practising again after classes
        finished. Sometimes, I taught by drawing routes in the dust with a stick. Other
        times, I sketched formations on paper or created simple digital diagrams so my
        teammates could visualize movement at home. When we couldn’t meet on the ground,
        we met online, talking through situations, replaying mistakes, or sometimes just
        staying connected before a match.
        </p>

        <p>
        Mentoring taught me to notice details most people miss. Who panics under pressure?
        Who needs encouragement instead of instruction? Who learns best by doing, and who
        learns by watching. I learned that leadership isn’t about giving orders; it’s about
        reading people in real time and adjusting before problems become visible.
        </p>

        <p>
        Kho Kho trained my eyes and mind. I stopped seeing chaos and started seeing patterns:
        a shoulder turning a fraction too early, a runner slowing before a change in
        direction, the exact second a decision must be made. Those micro-observations,
        measured in milliseconds, often decided entire matches.
        </p>

        <p>
        Over time, this way of thinking followed me off the field. I began approaching
        problems by breaking them into systems: inputs, reactions, and outcomes. I became
        curious about why small changes create big results. That curiosity is what drew
        me toward computer science.
        </p>

        <p>
        When I graduated from school, stepping away from daily practice was harder than I
        expected. I still wanted to teach, mentor, and pass on what I had learned, but I no
        longer had a ground full of juniors waiting after class. That gap became the reason
        for this website.
        </p>

        <p>
        <strong>Stride &amp; Lead</strong> is my attempt to preserve something that mattered
        deeply to me. It’s a digital ground for my juniors, for students who love the game,
        and for anyone curious about what sports can teach beyond rules and results. Here,
        I try to translate movement into understanding, experience into clarity, and
        leadership into something quiet but consistent.
        </p>

        <p>
        Kho Kho didn’t just teach me how to chase or escape. It taught me how to lose without
        resentment, how to win without arrogance, and how to respect opponents enough to
        learn from them. Some of the most important lessons came from teams that defeated us.
        Observing their discipline and composure shaped the way I later trained my own team.
        </p>

        
        <p>
        This site holds the work I did, the mistakes I learned from, and the thinking I want to keep refining. If you’re reading this from a place similar to where I once stood, unsure, curious, and
        searching, know that small, consistent effort builds more than talent ever could.
