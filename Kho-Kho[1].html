        <h2>How the game works (in simple words)</h2>
        <p>
          Kho Kho is played between two teams with clearly defined roles. One team chases,
          while the other runs. The chasing team sits in a zig–zag formation along the
          central lane, and only one chaser is active at a time. The running team sends
          players one by one into the court, aiming to stay untagged for as long as possible.
          </p>

          <p>
          The game isn’t about constant sprinting; it’s about timing, angles, and coordination.
          A well-planned “Kho” can shift pressure instantly, while a smart runner can slow
          the entire match down.
        </p>
        <ul class="kho-rules-list">
          <li>Only one chaser is active on the court at any moment.</li>
          <li>A chaser can pass responsibility by giving a clear “Kho” to a seated teammate.</li>
          <li>Runners score by staying untagged within the allotted time.</li>
          <li>Most points are decided by coordination, anticipation, and decision-making—not speed                   alone.</li>

          <h2>Tips for runners</h2>

          <p>
          A strong runner doesn’t just try to survive; she controls how the chasers move.
          The goal is not constant speed, but control: of distance, direction, and time.
          When done right, one runner can stretch the match long enough for the entire
          team to gain an advantage.
          </p>

          <h3>Start smart</h3>
          <p>
          At the beginning of your run, avoid sprinting immediately. Let the active
          chaser commit first. Standing slightly behind the seated chasers, rather than
          directly in the chaser’s line-gives you more reaction time and more turning
          options. If you stand in the same direction as the chaser, you become an easy
          target and signal where you’ll move next.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> If the chaser faces forward, position yourself just
          behind the seated players. This forces the chaser to turn before accelerating,
          buying you crucial milliseconds to escape or redirect.
          </p>

          <h3>Create a chase pattern without confusion</h3>
          <p>
          Random movement helps the chaser. Instead, guide them. Move past two or three
          seated chasers before changing direction. This creates repeated “Kho” calls,
          breaks rhythm, and increases fatigue in the chasing team.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Run past three seated chasers, turn sharply, then
          switch sides. When the chaser follows, another “Kho” is forced, resetting
          the chase and slowing the game.
          </p>

          <h3>Maintain distance at all times</h3>
          <p>
          A common mistake runners make is underestimating reach. Chasers do not need
          to run beside you to tag you; they can stretch their arms, bend low, or even
          jump forward. Always maintain at least two feet of distance.
          </p>

          <p>
          This is why running too close to boundaries or corners is risky. Limited space
          removes escape angles and allows chasers to stretch and tag without fully
          committing.
          </p>

          <h3>Use the pole as a control point, not a trap</h3>
          <p>
          The pole is one of the most powerful tools for a runner, but only if used
          deliberately. When a chaser dives for the pole, increase flexibility in your
          movement. Stay light on your feet, bend low, and be ready to switch direction
          instantly.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> If a chaser commits to a pole dive, hesitate for a
          fraction of a second, then change direction. That pause often forces overreach
          and creates space.
          </p>

          <h3>Control breath to control the last moments</h3>
          <p>
          Many runners get caught not because of poor movement, but because of breath
          loss. When you feel breath slipping, especially near the end of a run, slow
          intentionally. Short steps, controlled turns, and reduced sprinting help you
          recover without stopping.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Situation:</strong> If you can’t turn sharply due to exhaustion, move
          sideways instead of straight. This forces the chaser to adjust direction while
          you regain control.
          </p>

          <h3>Stay central, stay flexible</h3>
          <p>
          Staying near the middle or pole line keeps your options open. Constantly bend
          and shift your body; right, left, forward, backwards. Straight-line running
          limits adaptability and invites tagging.
          </p>

          <h3>Quick technique reminders</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stay low to turn faster.</li>
            <li>Avoid straight sprints unless necessary.</li>
            <li>Never wait at the boundary or corner.</li>
            <li>Watch the chaser’s shoulders—they turn before the feet.</li>
            <li>Change direction before the chaser fully commits.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>⚡ Smart runner coordination tip</h3>
          <p>
          When another runner is being chased, subtle movement from you can distract
          chasers for a split second. That moment is often enough for the active runner
          to slow down, breathe, and reset. Runner coordination matters more than it
          looks.
          </p>
        </section>


        <section id="chasers" class="kho-tip-section">
          <h2>Tips for chasers</h2>

          <p>
          A strong chaser doesn’t win alone. Chasing in Kho Kho depends on coordination,
          clarity of calls, and disciplined movement. When one call is missed or delayed,
          the runner gains time, breath, and control. Smooth chasing keeps pressure constant
          and leaves the runner with no room to recover.
          </p>

          <h3>Call cleanly, loudly, and on time</h3>
          <p>
          Every “Kho” should be clear enough that players, referees, and even spectators
          can hear it. A soft or delayed call breaks momentum and can cost points, or even
          lead to penalties. Make the call early, confidently, and without hesitation.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> If you wait an extra second to give a “Kho,” the runner
          gets a chance to slow down or change direction. A clean, early call keeps the
          chase continuous and prevents recovery.
          </p>

          <h3>Stretch, don’t travel</h3>
          <p>
          You don’t need to walk or run all the way to a teammate to give a “Kho.” Use your
          flexibility. Stretch your arm, lean your body, and tap efficiently. This saves
          time and keeps pressure high on the runner.
          </p>

          <p>
          Flexibility is a major advantage for chasers. A well-stretched call forces the
          runner to keep moving instead of resetting.
          </p>

          <h3>Maintain the chain—don’t break the flow</h3>
          <p>
          When a runner forces multiple “Kho” calls, your job is not to interrupt the chain.
          Breaking the flow gives runners time to breathe and reorganize. Stay committed
          to the sequence and move immediately after receiving the call.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Situation:</strong> If the runner passes two or three seated chasers in
          sequence, continue the chain smoothly instead of hesitating or changing plans.
          Continuity increases runner fatigue.
          </p>

          <h3>Target one runner until the job is done</h3>
          <p>
          Once a runner is selected as a target, stay with them. Switching targets mid-chase
          relieves pressure and allows runners to recover. Consistent targeting forces
          exhaustion and mistakes.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Exception:</strong> If another runner suddenly blocks your path or is
          directly within reach, adapt quickly. Otherwise, stay focused on your original
          target.
          </p>

          <h3>Use the pole aggressively, not passively</h3>
          <p>
          Near the pole, hesitation is costly. The first few pole dives may favor the runner,
          but quick, confident dives and sharp turns shift control. Avoid stopping, looking,
          or rethinking; commit fully.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> A chaser who takes immediate pole turns without pausing
          forces the runner to keep moving and lose balance over time.
          </p>

          <h3>Stretch for the tag, distance is deceptive</h3>
          <p>
          Runners often maintain distance, assuming they are safe. As a chaser, use your full
          reach. Stretch your arms, lean forward, and trust your flexibility. Many successful
          tags happen when the runner believes they are still out of reach.
          </p>

          <h3>Follow the runner’s direction—never fight it</h3>
          <p>
          If the runner commits to a direction and you hesitate or move the opposite way,
          control is lost. Commit early, move decisively, and force the runner to react
          instead of dictating.
          </p>

          <h3>Speed near the pole decides outcomes</h3>
          <p>
          Time wasted near the pole helps runners recover. The faster the first two chases
          near the pole happen, the quicker runners lose options. Sharp turns, fast calls,
          and continuous movement reduce their escape routes.
          </p>

          <h3>⚡ Smart chaser coordination tip</h3>
          <p>
          Before the chase begins, team planning matters. Decide the target in advance.
          The chaser starting from the pole (often called the <em>poler</em>) should know
          exactly whom to chase first. Clear signals like “Red jersey, number eight” remove
          hesitation and prevent confusion once the whistle blows.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> When the poler starts directly toward a pre-decided runner,
          pressure begins instantly. The runner has no time to settle, and the chasing team
          stays one step ahead instead of reacting late.
          </p>

          <h3>Quick chaser cues (match-time reminders)</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Decide the first target <em>before</em> the whistle.</li>
            <li>Move with purpose—no second-guessing.</li>
            <li>Use body angles to close space, not speed alone.</li>
            <li>Force the runner to turn first.</li>
            <li>Reset focus immediately after every call.</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="captains" class="kho-tip-section">
          <h2>For captains & leaders</h2>

          <p>
          Captaining a Kho Kho team means leading two roles at once, chasers and runners, 
          while keeping the team steady before, during, and after the match. A captain’s
          work begins long before the whistle and continues even after the game ends.
          </p>

          <h3>Read your team before you place them</h3>
          <p>
          Before every match, observe carefully. Notice who accelerates quickly, who turns
          sharply, who stretches easily, and who stays calm under pressure. These details
          matter more than labels or seniority.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>On the ground:</strong> Place flexible chasers and strong pole-divers near
          the poles. Chasers who give clear direction and control the chase belong in the
          middle. The fastest, most confident chaser usually starts as the poler.
          </p>

          <h3>Plan runner sets strategically</h3>
          <p>
          Most matches are decided by how the runner sets are used. Strong captains often place
          their fastest, most controlled runners in the first set so the game is stretched
          early. If the first set performs well, later sets face less pressure.
          </p>

          <p>
          The aim is not to reach the last set; it is to control the match so the outcome is
          decided earlier.
          </p>

          <h3>Build trust, not just discipline</h3>
          <p>
          A team does not work on instructions alone. Spend time understanding your players;
          how they react to pressure, how they handle mistakes, and when they need support.
          Celebrate small improvements, not just wins.
          </p>

          <p>
          Conflicts will happen. What matters is that they don’t carry onto the court.
          Coordination between chasers and runners only works when players feel heard
          and respected.
          </p>

          <h3>Be the bridge between coach and team</h3>
          <p>
          Coaches give structure, but captains give continuity. Make sure rules are clear,
          roles are understood, and no one feels lost. Speak individually when needed;
          not everyone responds the same way to group instructions.
          </p>

          <h3>Decide with intention during the toss</h3>
          <p>
          The toss sets the tone. Choosing to chase first often gives captains early control:
          you read the opponents’ runners, test their endurance, and gather information.
          That knowledge becomes an advantage when your team runs next.
          </p>

          <h3>Teach beyond the ground</h3>
          <p>
          Learning does not stop at practice. Discuss situations off the field; sometimes
          through drawings, notes, or simple questions like “What would you do here?”
          These conversations sharpen decision-making before it’s tested in real time.
          </p>

          <p>
          Even informal online sessions before matches, talking, reviewing plays, or just
          staying connected, help teams enter the ground more confident and coordinated.
          </p>

          <h3>Leave a system, not just memories</h3>
          <p>
          Strong captains aim to leave behind a way of thinking. When teammates understand
          the game deeply, they continue improving even after leadership changes.
          That continuity is a quiet form of success.
          </p>

          <p>
          <em>
          All the best. Lead with clarity, patience, and consistency. The results follow
          when the team feels secure enough to play freely.
          </em>

        <section id="off-field" class="kho-tip-section">
          <h2>Lessons that leave the court with you</h2>

          <p>
          A Kho Kho match ends with a whistle, but what stays doesn’t. Whether you win or
          lose, you don’t walk off the ground carrying just a score; you carry observations,
          conversations, and a better understanding of people, including yourself.
          </p>

          <h3>Winning teaches confidence. Losing teaches clarity.</h3>
          <p>
          Wins feel good, but losses teach more. When an opponent plays better, faster, or
          smarter, it becomes an opportunity to study rather than resent. Watching how a
          stronger team moves, communicates, and stays composed shows you what growth
          actually looks like.
          </p>

          <p>
          Some of the most valuable lessons come from teams that defeat you. Their discipline,
          patience, and coordination often stay in your mind long after the match ends.
          </p>

          <h3>Observation is a skill, not a habit</h3>
          <p>
          The court trains you to observe constantly: how a runner hesitates before turning,
          how a chaser commits early, how a team reacts after a mistake. Over time, you
          stop seeing just players and start seeing patterns.
          </p>

          <p>
          That habit carries into life. You listen more. You react less. You learn to pause
          before deciding.
          </p>

          <h3>Respect builds bridges faster than trophies</h3>
          <p>
          After matches, especially close ones, stepping toward opponents matters. A simple
          handshake, a congratulations, or a quiet conversation builds respect. Many rivals
          eventually become friends, people you exchange tips with, learn from, and remember.
          </p>

          <p>
          Networking doesn’t always begin in classrooms or conferences. Sometimes, it starts
          on dusty grounds, between two teams who gave their best.
          </p>

          <h3>Leadership is tested when emotions are high</h3>
          <p>
          Pressure exposes leadership. As a player or captain, you learn to manage frustration,
          fatigue, and disagreement without letting them damage coordination. Conflict is
          natural; how quickly a team recovers from it defines strength.
          </p>

          <p>
          The court teaches accountability, not blaming conditions, referees, or teammates,
          but focusing on what can be improved next.
          </p>

          <h3>Growth comes from shared experience</h3>
          <p>
          Practising within your own team is one thing. Competing against unfamiliar teams
          is another. Every tournament introduces new styles, new strategies, and new ways
          of thinking. Each match becomes a lesson you carry forward to train better and
          think deeper.
          </p>

          <h3>What the game quietly teaches</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>How to stay calm when attention is on you.</li>
            <li>How to recover quickly after mistakes.</li>
            <li>How to respect effort, not just outcomes.</li>
            <li>How to work with people who think differently.</li>
            <li>How to keep learning even when results don’t go your way.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Leaving the ground a little better</h3>
          <p>
          Over time, Kho Kho stops being just a sport. It becomes a way of understanding
          pressure, teamwork, and resilience. The ground teaches you how to carry yourself,
          win or lose, with clarity and grace.
          </p>

          <p>
          <em>
          All the very best for your next game. Play with intent, observe with curiosity,
          and leave every court carrying something valuable forward.
          </em>
