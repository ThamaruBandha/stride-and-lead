            From the Kho Kho ground to the classroom and parade track, I learned that
            leadership is built quietly—in moments of doubt, pressure, and courage.

          I never woke up one day and decided, “I’m a leader now.” It happened slowly:
          through sweaty practice sessions, cracked voices in the mic, and roll calls
          where I was responsible for every name. This page is a notebook of those
          moments—where I made mistakes, took responsibility, and slowly learned to
          stand in front of a group without running away.

            <p>
              Kho Kho was the first place where I felt the weight of leadership
              on my shoulders. I wasn’t just running and dodging anymore—I was
              reading faces, calming nerves, and calling decisions that could
              change the scoreboard. There were matches where our strategy failed,
              where I misread the game and we lost by a single point. Those were
              the evenings I stayed back on the ground, replaying each move in my
              head, promising myself that next time I would think clearer and guide
              my team better.

            <h3>Leading inside the classroom</h3>
            <p>
              Being a class leader taught me a different kind of courage. It wasn’t
              about shouting over noise; it was about earning quiet respect. I learned
              how to listen to complaints without taking sides, how to remind friends
              about deadlines without sounding like a teacher, and how to admit when I
              had passed on information incorrectly. Leadership here meant being
              reliable—showing up early, staying back late, and standing between the
              teacher and the class when something went wrong.

            <h3>Holding a mic, holding a team together</h3>
            <p>
              On the music side, leadership looked less like giving commands and more
              like keeping everyone in rhythm. During school events, I coordinated
              practice schedules, balanced different skill levels, and made sure the
              shy voices in the back row were heard. When the sound system failed
              five minutes before a performance, I had to keep the team calm, speak
              to the teachers, and help reset everything in time. Those messy backstage
              moments taught me how to stay composed when things go off-script.

            <h3>Calling commands for 50+ marching students</h3>
            <p>
              During March Past, I was responsible for leading a platoon of more than
              50–70 students. The first time I stood at the front, my voice shook more
              than my legs, but hundreds of eyes were still waiting for my command.
              I learned how to project my voice, pace my instructions, and keep the
              formation steady even when someone fell out of step. Leading a line of
              students across the ground taught me that confidence is often just
              responsibility plus practice.

          <div class="lead-story-text">
            <h3>What these roles taught me about real leadership</h3>
            <p>
              Across sports, music, and academics, the pattern stayed the same:
              leadership wasn’t a trophy or a title pinned on my chest. It was
              taking the first step when others were unsure, accepting blame when
              plans failed, and quietly giving credit when things went right.
              These experiences now guide the way I want to lead in future teams,
              tech projects, and college communities—by being the person who listens
              deeply, decides clearly, and keeps the group moving forward.
