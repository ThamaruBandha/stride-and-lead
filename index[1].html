        <h2 class="section-title">Where it all begins</h2>
        <p>
        I first stepped onto a Kho Kho ground in seventh grade, unsure of my speed and
        even more unsure of myself. The ground was dusty, the rules felt fast, and
        everything seemed to happen at once. But something about the game stayed with me.
        I didn’t just want to play; I wanted to experiment; what would happen if I take right turn instead of the left, what would be the result if I kept running from pole-to-pole.
        </p>

        <p>
        Over time, I grew into roles I never expected. I became a team captain, then a
        mentor for under-14 players, guiding teams through inter-school competitions.
        I learned how different the game feels when you’re responsible not just for your
        own decisions, but for everyone else’s confidence too.
        </p>

        <p>
        I went on to compete at the state level in Warangal, Telangana, where our team
        won first place, and later at the national level in Haryana, where we were placed third in the year 2023
        But what stayed with me wasn’t just the results; it was how the game trained my
        mind. I began watching motion instead of chaos: shoulders turning, hesitation
        before a sprint, the exact moment when a decision needs to be made.
        </p>

        <p>
        This site exists because of that way of seeing. For players who feel overwhelmed
        at first but still want to play. For students who want to understand the game,
        not just win medals.

          <h3>Game in motion</h3>
          <p>
            On the ground, nothing felt still. Dust rises, feet shift, and decisions happen before
            you finish thinking them. I learned to watch how a runner leans before changing direction,
            how a split second of hesitation can open a path, or close one forever.

          <h3>Team & trust</h3>
          <p>
          Kho Kho is never played alone. A glance, a planned Kho, knowing who will chase next;
          everything depends on trust. As a captain, I learned how quickly a team senses doubt,
          and how much confidence can travel through one calm voice.

          <h3>Beyond the trophies</h3>
          <p>
          Trophies mattered, but they were never the point. What stayed with me and my team were the             lessons(we created and practised throughout): respecting stronger opponents and learning               from them, staying disciplined even when no one is watching, and carrying confidence off the           field.

    <!-- WHAT YOU’LL LEARN -->
    <section class="learn-section">
      <div class="learn-text">
        <h2 class="section-title">What you’ll learn here</h2>
        <p>
        As you explore this site, you’ll move between two worlds that quietly shape each other:
        the game, and the way it teaches you to think.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the <a href="Kho-Kho.html" class="inline-link">Kho Kho section</a>, I walk through how
          I think as both a chaser and a runner, how routes are planned, how body language gives
          away intent, and how to recover mentally when a match turns unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
         You’ll find ideas that focus not just on speed, but on clarity: staying calm under pressure,
         reading situations faster, and making decisions that help the whole team move better                   together.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everything here comes from time spent on the ground, learning through mistakes,
         responsibility, and repetition. I hope that these pages help you play with more
         confidence, and think with more intention, wherever you find yourself next.
