# Stride & Lead 

**Kho Kho, Leadership & Decision-Making Through Sport**

Stride & Lead is a student-built web project that explores how the traditional Indian sport **Kho Kho** teaches decision-making, coordination, leadership, and situational awareness, both on and off the field.

The project combines sport analysis, storytelling, and front-end development to present practical insights for runners, chasers, and team leaders.

## What This Project Is About

Kho Kho is often seen as a fast physical game, but beneath the speed lies strategy, timing, and teamwork.
Stride & Lead focuses on:

* How runners control pace and space
* How chasers coordinate decisions under pressure
* How captains lead during fast-changing situations
* What lessons from the game transfer into real-world leadership

This site breaks those ideas down clearly and visually.
